  "## Deploy a simple S3 dispersed storage archive solution\n",
  "\n",
  "#### Requirements\n",
  "\n",
  "In order to be able to deploy this example deployment you will have to have the following components activated\n",
  "- the 3Bot SDK, in the form of a local container with the SDK, or a grid based SDK container. Getting started instuctions are [here](https://github.com/Threefoldfoundation/info_projectX/tree/development/doc/jumpscale_SDK) \n",
  "- if you use a locally installed container with the 3Bot SDK you need to have the wireguard software installed. Instructions to how to get his installed on your platform could be found [here](https://www.wireguard.com/install/)\n",
  "- capacity reservation are not free so you will need to have some ThreeFold_Tokens (TFT) to play around with. Instructions to get tokens could be found [here](https://github.com/Threefoldfoundation/info_projectX/blob/development/doc/jumpscale_SDK_information/payment/FreeTFT_testtoken.md)\n",
  "\n",
  "After following these install instructions you should end up having a local, working TF Grid SDK installed. You could work / connect to the installed SDK as described [here](https://github.com/Threefoldfoundation/info_projectX/blob/development/doc/jumpscale_SDK/SDK_getting_started.md)\n",
  "\n",
  "### Overview\n",
  "The design a simple S3 archive solution we need to follow a few simple steps:\n",
  "- create (or identify and use) an overlay network that spans all of the nodes needed in the solution\n",
  "- identify which nodes are involved in the archive for storage and which nodes are running the storage software\n",
  "- create reservations on the storage nodes for low level storage. Create and deploy zero-DB's\n",
  "- collect information of how to access and use the low level storage devices to be passed on to the S3 storage software\n",
  "- design the architecture, data and parity disk design\n",
  "- deploy the S3 software in a container\n",
  "\n",
  "#### Create overlay network of identity an previously deployed overlay network\n",
  "\n",
  "Each overlay network is private and contains private IP addresses. Each overlay network is deployed in such a way that is has no connection to the public (IPv4 or IPv6) network directly. In order to work with such a network a tunnel needs to be created between the overlay network on the grid and your local network. You could find instructions how to do that [here](https://github.com/Threefoldfoundation/info_projectX/blob/development/doc/jumpscale_SDK_examples/network/overlay_network.md)\n"
