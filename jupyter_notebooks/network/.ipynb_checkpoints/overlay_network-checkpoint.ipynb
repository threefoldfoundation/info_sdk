 "### Create a private overlay network\n",
 "\n",
 "In this example we will create an overlay network over a number of nodes in the TF Grid. The nodes and locations could be researched on this explorer site: http://explorer.grid.tf\n",
 "\n",
 "#### Requirements\n",
 "\n",
 "In order to be able to deploy this example deployment you will have to have the following components activated\n",
 "- the 3Bot SDK, in the form of a local container with the SDK, or a grid based SDK container. Getting started instuctions are [here](https://github.com/Threefoldfoundation/info_projectX/tree/development/doc/jumpscale_SDK) \n",
 "- if you use a locally installed container with the 3Bot SDK you need to have the wireguard software installed. Instructions to how to get his installed on your platform could be found [here](https://www.wireguard.com/install/)\n",
 "- capacity reservation are not free so you will need to have some ThreeFold_Tokens (TFT) to play around with. Instructions to get tokens could be found [here](https://github.com/Threefoldfoundation/info_projectX/blob/development/doc/jumpscale_SDK_information/payment/FreeTFT_testtoken.md)\n",
 "\n",
 "After following these install instructions you should end up having a local, working TF Grid SDK installed. You could work / connect to the installed SDK as described [here](https://github.com/Threefoldfoundation/info_projectX/blob/development/doc/jumpscale_SDK/SDK_getting_started.md)\n",
 "\n",
 "#### 1. Mainnet and Identity\n",
 "First load you identity and make sure you are talking to the production explorer. This is done by making sure you have set the default explorer to `explorer.grid.tf`. Also you have to have an indentity set.\n"
