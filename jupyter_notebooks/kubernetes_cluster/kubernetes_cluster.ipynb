 "## Deploy a a kubernetes cluster\n",
 "\n",
 "#### Requirements\n",
 "\n",
 "In order to be able to deploy this example deployment you will have to have the following components activated\n",
 "- the TF Grid SDK, in the form of a local container with the SDK, or a grid based SDK container. Getting started instuctions are [here](https://github.com/Threefoldfoundation/info_projectX/tree/development/doc/jumpscale_SDK) \n",
 "- if you use a locally installed container with the 3Bot SDK you need to have the wireguard software installed. Instructions to how to get his installed on your platform could be found [here](https://www.wireguard.com/install/)\n",
 "- capacity reservation are not free so you will need to have some ThreeFold_Tokens (TFT) to play around with. Instructions to get tokens could be found [here](https://github.com/Threefoldfoundation/info_projectX/blob/development/doc/jumpscale_SDK_information/payment/FreeTFT_testtoken.md)\n",
 "\n",
 "After following these install instructions you should end up having a local, working TF Grid SDK installed. You could work / connect to the installed SDK as described [here](https://github.com/Threefoldfoundation/info_projectX/blob/development/doc/jumpscale_SDK/SDK_getting_started.md)\n",

 "### Overview\n",
 "The design a simple kubernetes cluster we need to follow a few steps:\n",
 "- create (or identify and use) an overlay network that spans all of the nodes needed in the solution\n",
 "- identify which nodes are involved in the kubernetes cluster, master and worker nodes\n",
 "- create reservations for the kubernetes virtual machines.\n",
 "- deploy the kubernetes cluster.\n",
 "\n",
 "#### Create overlay network of identity an previously deployed overlay network\n",
 "\n",
 "Each overlay network is private and contains private IP addresses. Each overlay network is deployed in such a way that is has no connection to the public (IPv4 or IPv6) network directly. In order to work with such a network a tunnel needs to be created between the overlay network on the grid and your local network. You could find instructions how to do that [here](https://github.com/Threefoldfoundation/info_projectX/blob/development/doc/jumpscale_SDK_examples/network/overlay_network.md)\n"

 "#### Set up the capacity environment to find, reserve and configure\n",
 "\n",
 "Make sure that your SDK points to the mainnet explorer for deploying this capacity example. Also make sure you have an identity loaded. The example code uses the default identity. Multiple identities could be stored in the TF Grid SDK. To check your available identities you could request the number of identities available for you by typing `j.tools.threebot.me` in the kosmos shell.\n"
