 "#### Requirements\n",
 "\n",
 "In order to be able to deploy this example deployment you will have to have the following components activated\n",
 "- the TF Grid SDK, in the form of a local container with the SDK, or a grid based SDK container. Getting started instuctions are [here](https://github.com/Threefoldfoundation/info_projectX/tree/development/doc/jumpscale_SDK) \n",
 "- if you use a locally installed container with the 3Bot SDK you need to have the wireguard software installed. Instructions to how to get his installed on your platform could be found [here](https://www.wireguard.com/install/)\n",
 "- capacity reservation are not free so you will need to have some ThreeFold_Tokens (TFT) to play around with. Instructions to get tokens could be found [here](https://github.com/Threefoldfoundation/info_projectX/blob/development/doc/jumpscale_SDK_information/payment/FreeTFT_testtoken.md)\n",
 "\n",
 "After following these install instructions you should end up having a local, working TF Grid SDK installed. You could work / connect to the installed SDK as described [here](https://github.com/Threefoldfoundation/info_projectX/blob/development/doc/jumpscale_SDK/SDK_getting_started.md)\n",

 "The design a simple kubernetes cluster we need to follow a few steps:\n",
 "- create (or identify and use) an overlay network that spans all of the nodes needed in the solution\n",
 "- identify which nodes are involved in the kubernetes cluster, master and worker nodes\n",
 "- create reservations for the kubernetes virtual machines.\n",
 "- deploy the kubernetes cluster.\n",
 "\n",
 "#### Create overlay network of identity an previously deployed overlay network\n",
 "\n",
 "Each overlay network is private and contains private IP addresses. Each overlay network is deployed in such a way that is has no connection to the public (IPv4 or IPv6) network directly. In order to work with such a network a tunnel needs to be created between the overlay network on the grid and your local network. You could find instructions how to do that [here](https://github.com/Threefoldfoundation/info_projectX/blob/development/doc/jumpscale_SDK_examples/network/overlay_network.md)"

 "\n",
 "Make sure that your SDK points to the mainnet explorer for deploying this capacity example. Also make sure you have an identity loaded. The example code uses the default identity. Multiple identities could be stored in the TF Grid SDK. To check your available identities you could request the number of identities available for you by typing `j.tools.threebot.me` in the kosmos shell.\n"

 "#### What is an Flist? \n",
 "\n",
 "An Flist is a very special container images. One of the challenges with industry leading technologies like docker and kubernetes is that every node involved in an IT architecture has to have local copies of all of the images it needs to run as containers. These could either be base images on which specific modifications need to be made or they are specific images downloaded from the docker hub or a private image repository (enterprise use cases). Having these images exists on many different nodes requires these to be downloaded and maintained for version control and bug fixes. This is waistfull (many times the same image required storage space) and time consuming. \n",
 "\n",
 "The Flist solves that issue by facilitating container images to be made available on fly to nodes that needs the content of a container image over the network from a so called hub. There is a public hub that serves images but the hub facility is open source and could be replicated for private or corporate usage. The hub could be found here: `http://hub.grid.tf`.\n",
 "\n",
 "The Flist represents a very efficient way to distribute de-duped container image with a bandwidth optmised transfer process and increased security by signed files. For (a lot) more details please go here:\n",
 "\n",
 " * generic description [here](https://github.com/Threefoldtech/0-Flist/blob/development/doc/Flist.md)\n",
 " * GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/Threefoldtech/0-Flist)\n",
 " * FreeFlow pages [article](http://freeflowpages.com/content/perma?id=9396)\n",
 " \n",
 "On the public hub there is import functionality to import docker images and create Flists out of them. Another way to create your own tar archives and upload these to transform into Flists. More information with regards to creating, managing and using Flists could be found [here](https://hub.grid.tf/)"

 "#### Select which Flist to deploy?\n",
 "\n",
 "For this example we selected the code-server Flist in public hub. The code-server Flist is based on an open opensource software managed here: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode. Its visual studio code providing a very feature rich coding and code management environment. The Flist could be found [here](https://hub.grid.tf/weynandkuijpers.3Bot/codercom-code-server-latest.Flist).\n",
 "\n",
 "#### Node selection and parameters.\n",
 "You have created a network in the network creation [notebook](https://github.com/Threefoldfoundation/info_projectX/blob/development/code/jupyter/SDK_examples/network/overlay_network.ipynb) with the following details:\n",

 "demo_port=8030\n",
 "demo_network_name=\"demo_network_name_01\"\n",
 "```\n",
 "When you executed the reservation it also provided you with data on order number, node ID and private network range on the node. All the nodes in the network are connected peer2peer with a wireguard tunnel. On these nodes we could now launch the Flist. For this solution we will be using some of these nodes as master nodes and others as worker nodes.
