## How to query the available node?

Capacity nodes can be found, with their status, on the explorer websites : 

The [testnet explorer](https://explorer.grid.tf) 

The [mainnet explorer](https://explorer.testnet.grid.tf) 

The explorer allows you to find nodes based on criteria such as : 
- available capacity: compute (CRU), memory (MRU) and storage, both SSD (SRU) and HDD (HRU)
- location

The details for each node gives more specification and status of the node.
