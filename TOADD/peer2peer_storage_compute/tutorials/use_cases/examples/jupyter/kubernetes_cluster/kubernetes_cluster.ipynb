    "- if you use a locally installed container with the 3bot SDK you need to have the wireguard software installed.  Instructions to how to get his installed on your platform can be found [here](https://www.wireguard.com/install/)\n",
    "- capacity reservation are not free so you will need to have some ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) to play around with.  Instructions to get tokens can be found [here](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_projectX/blob/development/doc/jumpscale_SDK_information/payment/FreeTFT_testtoken.md)\n",

    "- create (or identify and use) an overlay network that spans all of the nodes needed in the solution\n",

    "- create reservations for the kubernetes virtual machines.\n",
    "- deploy the kubernetes cluster.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each overlay network is private and contains private IP addresses.  Each overlay network is deployed in such a way that is has no connection to the public (IPv4 or IPv6) network directly.  In order to work with such a network a tunnel needs to be created between the overlay network on the grid and your local network.  You can find instructions how to do that [here](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_projectX/blob/development/doc/jumpscale_SDK_examples/network/overlay_network.md)\n"
