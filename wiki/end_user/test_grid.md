# Testing The ThreeFold_Grid using TestLodge

After each release of every newer grid version, we invite everyone within ThreeFold Community to test the grid's product components and give our engineering team constructive feedback on our product development.

We have chosen to use TestLodge as our QA and testing platform. Testlodge is a platform that enable ThreeFold to manage our products' test plans, test cases & test runs with ease. By joining TestLodge as a user, you could then assist us in running test use cases and reporting issues found during our product deployment processes.

- **Total Test Plans**: is the amount of test plans, or products being tested on this project.
- **Total Requirement Docs**: is the amount of testing documentation provided for each test on this project.
- **Total Test Suites**: is the amount of individual test use cases for every product being tested on this project. This is the test procedures you would be doing as a user / tester.
- **Total Test Runs**: is the amount of individual testing round of every user that has been created for this project. Each tester would have their own Test Run serving as a testing dashboard where you can report the result of every test. You would need to **create a Test Run** with your name as the title to get started with testing the **TF Grid Test Suites**.

### Creating Your Own Personal Test Run

#### An example of a test run: Test the deployment of eVDC using eVDC Deployer

Click on 'Test Runs' tab on the top navigation bar and create a new test run by clickin on 'New Test Run'.
