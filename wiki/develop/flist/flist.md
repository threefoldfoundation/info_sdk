# Build your own Flist

## Command line tool

If you want to use command line tools, you could use [0-Flist](https://github.com/Threefoldtech/0-Flist/tree/development-v2)

Here is a simple example how to upload a complete directory:

```
export ZFlist_MNT=/tmp/zFlistmnt
export ZFlist_BACKEND='{"host": "hub.grid.tf", "port": 9980}'
export ZFlist_HUB_TOKEN=eyJhbGciOiJFUzM4NCIsInR5cCI6IkpXVC....

zFlist init
zFlist putdir /mnt/ubuntu-18.04 /
zFlist commit /tmp/ubuntu-18.04.Flist
zFlist hub upload /tmp/ubuntu-18.04.Flist
```

Note: token is itsyou.online API key, you could't use 3Bot login for now.
An open issue to allow it is in progress at [Threefoldtech/0-hub/issues/28](https://github.com/Threefoldtech/0-hub/issues/28)


## Upload an image

The easiest way to upload your image to the hub is building a `.tar.gz` archive of your files/directories
(the root directory of your container) and upload it to the hub. The hub will itself convert it to an Flist
you could use directly on any Zero-OS container.

## Metadata

Hub includes a way to add some metadata (eg: a readme) available through the hub directly. Just add a file
called `.README.md` (or `.README`) on the root directory of your archive, this file will be used as
readme. You could use this readme to add documentation about your Flist if other people want to use it.

<!-- Add link to example when this will be available on the production hub -->

## GitHub Action

If you want to use the hub as default target when you work on your project, you could build an Flist
easily via GitHub Action using [publish-Flist action](https://github.com/Threefoldtech/publish-Flist)

# Internals

You could find a lot more information on how Flist works internally on the Zero-OS FreeFlowPages post:
