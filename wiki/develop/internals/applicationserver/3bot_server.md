# 3Bot Server

3Bot server is an application server based on nginx and [gedis](rpc). It could further be extended using packages.

When adding packages to a server, they should first be defined, then added to the 3Bot server then the server could be started.

## Staring 3Bot

### Using threebot command
`threebot` command could be used to start/stop 3Bot and to check for current running 3Bot status. This will give you a ready shell in the same process where you could interact with your 3Bot:

It could be used to start a 3Bot server on standard ports (http and https).

```
threebot start
```

In case you need to start a local 3Bot, ny passing `--local` option will, it will search for free port on `80xx` range and starts 3Bot on this port.

```
threebot start --local
```

You could then access its admin on https://localhost/admin

### Manual start

Start 3Bot server from `jsng` shell:

```python
jsng

JS-NG> threebot_server = j.servers.threebot.get(domain="<optional><your-threebotdomain>", email="<your email><required if you want to use domain and ssl for certbot>")
JS-NG> threebot_server.save()
JS-NG> threebot_server.start()
```

It should start nginx for you too, if it's not stared, you could start it manually:

```
sudo nginx -c ~/sandbox/cfg/nginx/main/nginx.conf
```

### Nginx and privileged ports

Most of the times, you'll need to allow nginx to listen on privileged ports (80 and 443):

To increase its capabilities to be able to use port 80 and 443, using this command:

```bash
sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep `which nginx`
```

## APIs
APIs could be added as actors to your package, which are exposed directly and could be accessed via http or using our `gedis` clients for python or javascript.

*Actors in more detail are documented [here](actors).

## Packages
Packages are the way to write extensions and applications to your 3Bot server and it could be driven by an optional package.py file which controls the life cycle of the application including install, uninstall,start .. etc.

*Packages in more detail are documented [here](packages).

## ssl

- If you to generate certificates to your website/package you could specify it in the package.toml explicitly.

for example

```toml
name = "admin"
ports = [80, 443]

[[static_dirs]]
name = "frontend"
path_url = ""
path_location = "frontend/output/"
index = "index.html"
spa = true
is_admin = true

[[servers]]
name = "default"
ports = [80, 443]
domain = "waleed.grid.tf" # your domain name
letsencryptemail = "aa@example.com" # email to get notifications from lets encrypt

[[servers.locations]]
type = "proxy"
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 80
name = "admin"
path_url = "/"
path_dest = "/admin/"
```

- If you want to have default domain for your 3Bot, define it in the 3Bot start

```python
threebot_server = j.servers.threebot.get(domain="<optional><your-threebotdomain>", email="<your email><required if you want to use domain and ssl for certbot>")
threebot_server.start()
```

This will use certbot to generate a certificate for your domain
