This page lets you inspect all the workloads you ever deployed on the grid. 
The table lets you filter workloads based on:

* **workload ID**: The unique identifier of the workload.
* **Workload Type**: Only shows a workload of a certain type.
* **Capacity Pools**: Only shows workload linked to a specific capacity pool.
* **Next Action**: Only shows workload that is in a particular state.

By clicking on a workload, you open the detail view:
