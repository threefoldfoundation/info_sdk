# 3Bot Backup


The 3Bot backup is a service that backs up the data of your 3Bot. This backup can help recover your 3Bot. 

## Get Started on Backup

Hosted 3Bot offers 2 different types of backup services:
- Marketplace
- Minio

> The first backup is created when a hosted 3Bot is initialized.

> Backups of a hosted 3Bot will be stored by the 3Bot deployer service.

Meanwhile, the local 3Bot only offers one type of backup service: __Minio Backup__

You can also select to make automatic backups every 24 hours, or you can initiate a backup with a custom tag.

### Marketplace Backup

The marketplace backup is a service that is installed by default when you initialize a 3Bot. It automatically takes a snapshot of your data the moment your 3Bot is live.

### Minio backup

The minio backup is a service that is not installed by default. For it to make backups of your 3Bot, you need to run your own instance of minio.

> Follow this detailed guide to deploy an instance of [minio](solution_storage)

If you wish to run minio backups you can enable it by clicking on __Minio__ -> __Init Now__.

Following is required to make minio backups:

- Minio URL
- Access key
- Secret key
- Password

## Recovering with Marketplace Backup

For a backup to be recovered, you need to have the following information:
- The 3Bot name
- The password associated to it.

If you wish to recover your 3Bot you can use following deployers:

- For __Mainnet hosted 3Bot__ Go to [3Bot Deployer Website](https://deploy3bot.grid.tf)
- For __Testnet hosted 3Bot__ Go to [3Bot Deployer Website For Testnet](https://deploy3bot.testnet.grid.tf)

Select __Deploy a new 3Bot__ -> __Recover__

Follow the steps in the chat flow, and you should be able to recover your 3Bot.

## Recovering with MinIO Backup

Recovering a backup with MinIO requires some manual work. It backs up the configuration in ~/.config/jumpscale and if autobackup is enabled, it will do so every 24 hours.

- Right now visiting https://localhost/backup/actors/minio/restore will restore the last snapshot available.

- if you want to restore the latest snapshot from shell:

```
JS-NG> restic = j.tools.restic.minio_backup 
JS-NG> restic.restore("/")
```
- You can also restore a specific snapshot using  `restore(target_path, snapshot_id=None)`.
And to get all the snapshots:
```
JS-NG> restic.list_snapshots()
