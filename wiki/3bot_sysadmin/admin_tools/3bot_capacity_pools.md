# Introducing: Capacity Pools

Capacity Pool is one of the most exciting features made available on TF Grid 2.2. It's a feature to reserve capacity on the grid to deploy your solutions on.

By doing just a few clicks, you will be able to reserve IT capacity for your projects directly by creating multiple capacity pools. 

Ordering capacity directly from your chosen farms is quite simple. Just put the amount of Storage Unit (SU) and Capacity Unit (CU) needed and conduct a direct payment via your Stellar wallet for your reservation. You will be able to also extend your current capacity pool to a larger quote once it’s activated.

Basically, the capacity pool is a pre-allocation of compute and storage capacity to run your workloads on afterwards. You pay for this capacity during reservation but you 'consume' the capacity only after deployment of workloads. This way, you only pay for the capacity that is really consumed.
