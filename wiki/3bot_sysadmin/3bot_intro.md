# 3Bot Server

The ThreeFold system uses dispersed storage algorithms and is very different. In a dispersed storage system the data gets dispersed in such a way that data will always be available even if 4 sites of the 20 (in this case) would not be available. Redundancy is the same as in the above example but the overhead is 20x less. It also has clear benefits from a security and efficiency perspective. This has been originally invented for communication in space.

## How is this “Space Algorithm” used by the 3Bot

By nature, a 3Bot is stateless (has no data storage of its own). A 3Bot owns digital currency ( ThreeFold_Token or TFT) which the 3Bot could use to reserve raw storage and compute resources on the grid.

Each 3Bot has a unique capability to use this CPU and storage capacity from the different TFNodes in the TF Grid in a safely and reliably. Data could not be lost because of the above described dispersed storage algorithm. A 3Bot could store a petabyte of information as long as enough TFTs are available so the required resource could be reserved on the individual TFNodes. 3Bot is the only entity that has the required information and keys to make retrieval of the distributed data possible.
