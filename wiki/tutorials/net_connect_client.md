# How to set up a network connection

Deploying a workload on the TF Grid requires that the nodes that you intend to use for running a workload on, need to be interconnected to each other. 
To achieve this, the overlay network solution implemented in Zero-OS is based on [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.io). 

Make sure you have [Wireguard installed](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) if you intend to deploy workload that runs on different nodes.
