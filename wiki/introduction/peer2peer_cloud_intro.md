A new standard in peer2peer cloud = networking, storage and computing capacity.

- Capacity in over 21 countries like: United States, Austria, Belgium, etc.
- 100% private: you own all your data running in your environment.
- Release your workloads to the World Wide Web through our Web Gateways
- Encrypted network connections between all your containers through overlay networks

This manual is meant to provide you with all the information you need to get started on the peer2peer cloud.

### A new internet based on a new Peer2Peer Cloud

Cloud is the IT capacity which makes the internet possible, it's where the applications and your storage lives.
Today, 90% of "the cloud" is owned by less than 20 companies worldwide.

We believe there is a requirement for an upgraded internet where all of us together deliver this new cloud.

> Cloud is the IT capacity which empowers the internet.
> IT: Information Technology (applications, storage, compute, ...)

### Why peer2peer?

We believe the future of the internet is to be created, owned, and operated by many people, not by a happy few. The current version of the internet is not ready to move forward and create sovereignty, equality, and sustainability. A token economy that allows anyone to become a producer and consumer of digital services with the aim to reach 1 Billion people by 2030 is the vision of the ThreeFold Foundation. Peer2peer is the only answer to reach this vision, and without the risk of it being hijacked for different (commercial) interests of a few.

The peer2peer cloud provides compute, storage and networking services as a world's first in one architecture creating a sovereign, equal and sustainable cloud by many for anyone. [cloud.Threefold.io](https://cloud.Threefold.io)

### How does this Peer2Peer Cloud work.

- Farmers buy hardware (compute & storage devices) and connect them to the internet, as such they provide IT capacity to their peers. Any person and or company can become a farmer.
- Everyone who needs IT capacity (developers, IT system administrators) can buy this from farmers in a fully peer2peer way.

The administration of your workloads is Peer2Peer (decentralized).

There is a bootstrap service which allows you to deploy your 3Bot on the ThreeFold_Grid (you can also install the 3Bot software on your own computer).

A 3Bot is your virtual system administrator, and through your own 3Bot which none from ThreeFold has access to, you administer your IT workloads on top of the TF Grid (the network of capacity).

You can do this by means through deployment wizards as part of the 3Bot user interface, or if you are an advance user, you can create scripts which run on your 3Bot.

Solution providers create solutions on top of the ThreeFold_Grid. The ThreeFold Foundation is also creating The ThreeFold Marketplace which makes it easy for end users to deploy your own decentralized applications on top of the TF Grid see http://now.threefold.io
