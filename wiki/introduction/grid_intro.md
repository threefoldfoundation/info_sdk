# The Need For A New Internet Grid

The Internet is growing at an accelerated rate. To service this demand a few large companies (Google, Amazon, Alibaba, Facebook, etc.) have built and continue to build supersized, power-hungry and centralized data centers. These data centers make up the majority of all Internet capacity available today.

However, the Internet is expanding much faster than data centers and the planet could cope with.

The solution is to have the Internet be more **distributed**, **cost**-**effective**, **neutral,** and **sustainable**. ThreeFold has developed such a new technology, the ThreeFold_Grid (Grid) and a token which enables all this to happen.

> And you could become a part of this solution by becoming a farmer and add more decentralized capacity to the ThreeFold_Grid.

## details

The TF Grid is a peer-to-peer and autonomous Internet grid that provides game-changing performance and unfolds new possibilities. It sets the foundation for a better Internet.

The TF Grid is:

- **Peer2Peer**: no intermediaries anymore. On the ThreeFold_Grid consumers go directly to the source. So for example if two friends call each other on a secure peer-to-peer application that lives on the TF Grid, only them will have data about the call, no one else, not even us!
- **Decentralized**: The TF Grid's capacity is distributed across 20+ countries at launch. TF's decentralized. architecture brings many benefits such as security, cost efficiency, sustainability and much more. The expansion and reach to regions that need internet capacity the most will be incentivized and/pr sponsored by the Foundation.
- **Autonomous**: Making use of self-sustainable and self-healing, the TF Grid is extremely resilient and enables data to be available even in the unlikely case a node on which data is stored goes down. First of tis kind, the TF Grid autnomous technology removes all the layers of complexity present in the current internet.
- **Private & secure**: By removing the need for human intervention, it eliminates many backdoors present in current architecture. Combined with the peer-to-peer and autonomous approach, users benefit from an incredibly private digital life.
- **Efficient**: Less is more. By reducing the layers of complexity, the TF Grid enables to code and develop up-to 10x faster.
- **Equal**: Internet access should be available to everyone. The TF Grid solutions position themselves as the most affordable on the market. The expansion of the TF Grid to remote regions of our world will be incentivized and/or sponsored by the Foundation.
- **Sustainable**: The TF Grid is up-to 90% more sustainable than centralized alternatives on the market.

## The ThreeFold_Grid is active

TF Grid today has:

- +18000 CPU cores
- +90,000,000 GB of online storage

TF Grid is the largest peer-to-peer network of Internet (compute, storage and network) capacity in the world. The sum of all IT capacity in the TF Grid is larger than the sum of all IT capacity as used for all blockchain projects (May 2020). This may sound a lot but actually its still small compared to the massive centralized cloud vendors.

The system is not distributed enough yet, there are only 50-60 locations, more farmers are needed to grow the grid to its full potential.

The ThreeFold_Grid needs computers (servers) to function. Servers of all shapes and sizes could be added to the ThreeFold_Grid, by anyone, anywhere in the world. Zero-OS is an opensource operating system which needs to be run on the servers to make them extend the grid. People who add these computers to the grid are called farmers. This is a fully decentralized process, farmers downloads the Zero-OS operating system and boot their servers (3Nodes). The 3Nodes will register themselves in a database called TFDirectory and TF Grid users could then find the capacity they need to run their applications.

## How mature is the TF Grid?

- Our Zero-OS is beta quality and is at 2nd major release.
- The workloads could be registered using json format for our smart contract for IT layer.
- Experts could use any development language to use the grid as is by using this smart contract for IT layer.
- We could use some help to improve the documentation though.
