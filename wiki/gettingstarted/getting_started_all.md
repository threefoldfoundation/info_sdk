# Getting Started

At the moment, you can either deploy your solutions on TF Grid 2.4 (testnet) or TF Grid 2.3 (mainnet).

- To get started and deploy a solution on top of the TF Grid 2.4  testnet, go to  [__ThreeFold edge-Virtual Data Center (eVDC) Manual__](https://vdc.testnet.grid.tf). 

- To get started and deploy a solution on top of the TF Grid 2.3 (mainnet), you can go to [__ThreeFold's 3Bot SDK Manual__](3bot). The eVDC is not available on top of the Grid 2.3 and below.

> Please keep in mind that the two networks are completely separated, and thus every activity done on testnet cannot be applied to the mainnet, and vice versa.
