Testnet TFT will be successfully added to your token list and a TFT Trustline will be automatically added for your wallet.

> Please keep in mind that the testnet and mainnet networks are completely separated, and thus every activity done on testnet cannot be applied to the mainnet, and vice versa. For example, You would not be able to purchase capacity on TF Grid mainnet by using the testnet TFT you have on your testnet wallet.

### Claim Testnet TFT on Your Wallet Address
