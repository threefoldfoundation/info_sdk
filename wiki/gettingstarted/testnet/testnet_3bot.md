There are 2 ways you could run a 3Bot on testnet network: you could either run a **Testnet Hosted 3Bot** online via your web browser, or for more advanced users, you could install and run a **Testnet Local 3Bot** manually on your local machine.

To deploy a Testnet hosted 3Bot online, you would need to follow a deployment tutorial and go to the **Testnet 3Bot D Deployer** website. To deploy a Mainnet Local 3Bot on your computer, you would need to follow a tutorial on setting up a local 3Bot locally on main network.
