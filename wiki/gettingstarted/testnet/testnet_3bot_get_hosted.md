# Getting a hosted 3Bot  on TF Grid Testnet


You can get a hosted 3Bot on testnet [here](https://deploy3bot.testnet.grid.tf). 
Browse to the website and log in using your ThreeFold Connect app. Please, make sure to have a TFT funded Stellar wallet, such as the [Threefold Connect App](threefold:threefold_connect) so you can extend the lifetime of your 3Bot once deployed. The same tokens are used, however pricing for capacity on testnet is cheaper than on mainnet (1/10 dd. March 2021)

Once you're in, you can either `Deploy a new 3bot`, or you can view the hosted 3Bots that you have created before for recovery (`View my existing 3Bots`). All 3Bots are backed up, so recovery is possible. 

Select `Deploy a new 3Bot` and `Create`

Choose a password, needed for recovery afterwards:

Choose the first expiry date of your 3Bot. You will have to pay an amount for the 3Bot to be hosted until that date (extending is possible).

And you're done ! 
Now your hosted 3Bot is available at the indicated url.
