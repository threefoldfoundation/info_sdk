# Quantum-Safe Network System

!!!include threefold:quantumsafe_network_concept

--- 

- Private part of Planet Secure Network =end2end encrypted network layer between compute layer and users. 
- Optional: FPGA based network switch & NIC (work in progress): 
hundreds of gbits of bandwidth, no need for TCPIP in the fabric, super low latency, 0 backdoors

- Interfaces
  - VXlan
  - IPv6
  - Bridge to Public Network
  - WireGuard
  - HTTP(S) proxy
  - ...
- end2endencrypted overlay network between all IT workloads as running in Zero-OS
- Scales to planetary levels
