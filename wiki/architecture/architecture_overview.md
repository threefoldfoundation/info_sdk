# Architecture 

## Inspired by Nature

A decentralized architecture is exactly how nature is organized. Each of the cells has and an individual role, contributing to an overarching goal, but they are not instructed by a central system.
These cells can operate in a decentralized infrastructure of capacity and transportation.

We believe a digital ecosystem should behave the same way, creating a symbiosis of infrastructure and operators. Without a central command center, without a hierarchy.

The ThreeFold Grid represents this infrastructure, the 3Bot Virtual System Administrators (VSAs) are the cells to make the ecosysteml operational.

## Three Layers

Three layers interact to make the ThreeFold Grid operational: 
- the **capacity layer** delivers the storage, compute and network capacity that any IT solution can run on. 
- the **autonomous layer** brings in the self-driving/self-healing into the system, and, with it, resilience.
- the **experience layer** is where any IT workload or user facing web technology can be plugged in.
