# Foundational layer for a decentralized IT

The IT world can benefit from the ThreeFold technology in different ways.

On the one hand, it gives the opportunity for developers to deploy decentralized applications, with the Digital Twin representing the user in the digital world, who needs to remain in control of his data and his workload. 
Also traditional market in the IT world can find the tooling they are used to on the threeFold Grid. Existing standards such as Docker, Kubernetes, S3 storage, ... are supported in the developed framework.

It brings tooling for different audiences: 
- A DevOps engineer can use Docker, Kubernetes, the Planetary Filesystem, ... out-of-the-box on the ThreeFold Grid.
- A developer can use the 3Bot Virtual System Administrator (VSA) to create a private environment for many peer-to-peert applications.
- Many solutions are readily available on the Marketplace in the VDC, and can be deployed with a simple flow. It's the perfect toolkit for supporting a digital community. 
- The 3Bot VSA component is being extended to become the 'Digital Twin', a user's representation and agent for his full digital life.
