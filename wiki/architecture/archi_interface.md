# Web 3.0 Interface Layer 

This is the emulation layer which exposes services over a standard interface format. 

- **Secure browser engine** = no need to run javascript on your mobile or desktop. Only the output of your secure browser engine process is shown in your desktop or mobile os, no more need for browser in your desktop/mobile device.
- The **Web gateway** mimics the web interface and other internet interfaces and transports the data itself in secure way over a network wall.
