This page let you explorer the TF Grid. It shows some statistics about the overall usage of the grid and the detail about all the active nodes and gateways.

Using the `Capacity finder` panel, you can filter out the nodes based on their farm and resource units.

By clicking on a node or a gateway, you deploy the information view:

The information view let you inspect a specific node or gateway in more detail. Next to basic information (like farm, location, uptime), you can also find the primitives currently provisioned on the node and how much resource is available on the node or gateway.
