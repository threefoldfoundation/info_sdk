The next steps are identical to the creation of a new pool. 

### Specify the extension

Specify the amount of CU you want to add to the capacity pool, the amount of SU and the pool's 'time-to-live' (amount + unit).
For the definition of the 3 fields above (CU, SU, time-to-live), please check [Create a Capacity Pool](3bot_capacity_new.md). 

Indicate also the token you wish to pay with. It does not matter what was the token you paid with for previous capacity pool reservations.

Remark: The values to be introduced are about the extended volumes, not the resulting capacity after extension.
