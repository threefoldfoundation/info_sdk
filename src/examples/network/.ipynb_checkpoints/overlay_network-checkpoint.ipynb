    "In order to be able to deploy this example deployment you will have to have the following components activated\n",
    "- the 3bot SDK, in the form of a local container with the SDK, or a grid based SDK container.  Getting started instuctions are [here](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_projectX/tree/development/doc/jumpscale_SDK) \n",
    "- if you use a locally installed container with the 3bot SDK you need to have the wireguard software installed.  Instructions to how to get his installed on your platform can be found [here](https://www.wireguard.com/install/)\n",
    "- capacity reservation are not free so you will need to have some ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) to play around with.  Instructions to get tokens can be found [here](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_projectX/blob/development/doc/jumpscale_SDK_information/payment/FreeTFT_testtoken.md)\n",
