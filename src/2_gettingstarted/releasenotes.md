# release notes TFGrid 2.0.4.beta

![](releasenotes.png)

## experts and scripters only

- the current release is not intended for an end user audience, there is no easy to use interface
- the sdk which you can run on your computer or in the grid itself allows you to develop solutions on top of the grid.

## known issues

- 3sdk installer windows suport is early beta quality level, it did not receive enough exposure yet
- documentation is not good enough yet, we will be adding lots of content over next weeks
- the 3sdk installer needs to improve (less verbose errors, more support for user edge cases, ...)
- python notebooks and visual codeserver can use a lot of memory (these are 3e party components we use and we cannot resolve this)

## how to get support

- use chat on any of our websites
- use the support section in our forum at https://forum.threefold.io/
