3Bot will be your digital twin, that will execute your digital needs. 
It is an unprecedented leap in digital privacy and comes with all the functionalities you need to interact and exchange on the new Internet. 

Follow the steps below to set up your 3Bot Connect wallet, and receive and send your first ThreeFold Tokens:

### Install the 3Bot connect app on your phone.
  
To use the 3Bot Connect App you need to download the 3Bot Connect App available in the Appstore or Google Play Store. Follow the steps and register using your email address.

### Step 3: Save the seed phrase in a safe place.

In the future, these seed words are required to restore your wallet in case your device is lost.

The seed phrase allows you to access and recover your 3Bot connect on any device. We highly recommend to write down your seed key on a paper and store it safely offline. The seed phrase is the only "key" to your 3Bot and 3Bot assets (not only digital currency but also all of the reservations, deployments and data storage on the P2P cloud)

### A few very important things to remember

- **ThreeFold or any related party does not have any access to or maintain records of your private key.**
    - It is your personal responsibility to keep your 24-word private key in a safe place.
- **Do not share your private key with anyone, it is strictly personal.** 
- **Losing your private key means losing access to your wallet and all your ThreeFold Tokens.**
- **Anybody with access to your private key can take ownership of your 3Bot Connect wallet and ThreeFold Tokens.**
- **To access your wallet from another wallet (on another phone or online) you will need your private key (seed).**
    - without this private key your account cannot be recovered on another device or online wallet.
