# Low Redundancy

The [Planetary Secure File System](archi_psfs) gives a guarantee that data does not get lost, yet uses the lowest level of data redundancy possible. Unlike classic systems, where full copies are taken from the data as a backup, overhead in the PSFS can be reduced to about 20%, which is a factor 20 lower.
