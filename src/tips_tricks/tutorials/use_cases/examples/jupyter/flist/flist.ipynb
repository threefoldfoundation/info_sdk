    "- the Jumpscale SDK, in the form of a local container with the SDK, or a grid based SDK container.  Getting started instuctions are [here](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_projectX/tree/development/doc/jumpscale_SDK) \n",
    "- if you use a locally installed container with the 3bot SDK you need to have the wireguard software installed.  Instructions to how to get his installed on your platform can be found [here](https://www.wireguard.com/install/)\n",
    "- capacity reservation are not free so you will need to have some ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) to play around with.  Instructions to get tokens can be found [here](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_projectX/blob/development/doc/jumpscale_SDK_information/payment/FreeTFT_testtoken.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "After following these install instructions you should end up having a local, working jumpscale SDK installed.  You can work / connect to the installed SDK as described [here](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_projectX/blob/development/doc/jumpscale_SDK/SDK_getting_started.md)\n",

    "- create (or identify and use) an overlay network that spans all of the nodes needed in the solution\n",
    "- identify which nodes are involved in the kubernetes cluster, master and worker nodes\n",
    "- create reservations for the kubernetes virtual machines.\n",
    "- deploy the kubernetes cluster.\n",

    "#### Create overlay network of identity an previously deployed overlay network\n",
    "\n",
    "Each overlay network is private and contains private IP addresses.  Each overlay network is deployed in such a way that is has no connection to the public (IPv4 or IPv6) network directly.  In order to work with such a network a tunnel needs to be created between the overlay network on the grid and your local network.  You can find instructions how to do that [here](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_projectX/blob/development/doc/jumpscale_SDK_examples/network/overlay_network.md)"

    "#### What is an flist?  \n",
    "\n",
    "An flist is a very special container images.  One of the challenges with industry leading technologies like docker and kubernetes is that every node involved in an IT architecture has to have local copies of all of the images it needs to run as containers. These can either be base images on which specific modifications need to be made or they are specific images downloaded from the docker hub or a private image repository (enterprise use cases).  Having these images exists on many different nodes requires these to be downloaded and maintained for version control and bug fixes.  This is waistfull (many times the same image required storage space) and time consuming. \n",
    "\n",
    "The flist solves that issue by facilitating container images to be made available on fly to nodes that needs the content of a container image over the network from a so called hub.  There is a public hub that serves images but the hub facility is open source and can be replicated for private or corporate usage.  The hub can be found here: `http://hub.grid.tf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flist represents a very efficient way to distribute de-duped container image with a bandwidth optmised transfer process and increased security by signed files.  For (a lot) more details please go here:\n",

    "    \n",
    "On the public hub there is import functionality to import docker images and create flists out of them. Another way to create your own tar archives and upload these to transform into flists.  More information with regards to creating, managing and using flists can be found [here](https://hub.grid.tf/)"
