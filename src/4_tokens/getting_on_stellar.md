## Getting TFT's on the Stellar network

<!--
TODO Generic description to get yourself / your 3bot.connect on the stellar network and get (free) TFT's
-->

### Getting your 3bot connect to the Stellar network

The 3Bot Connect app has a wallet inside, accessed using either the seed keys of the 3Bot connect app or an imported seed key. 
The wallet allows you to show your balance in TFTs and FreeTFTs, as well as transferring (sending and receiving) tokens. 
Trading on the StellarX DEX is not yet possible using 3Bot Connect app (under construction). This is why it can be useful to install other wallets, which are able to do trades on the Stellar DEX. 

### How to get a Stellar account in the 3Bot Connect app

In the wallet section of a 3Bot you can set up an account with a trustline to all Threefold tokens: TFT, FreeTFT and TFTA. 
Also by importing the seed keys of a wallet registered on the TFchain (Rivine technology), the conversion mechanism automatically sets up trust lines on the Stellar blockchain. 

Once activation is done and trustlines are established, you can start sending and receiving tokens. 

### Getting other Stellar wallets to add a TFT or FreeTFT account

All Threefold tokens are registered on Stellar. This implies that these tokens can also be kept on any Stellar wallet.
A list of available Stellar wallets can be found [here](https://www.stellar.org/ecosystem/projects?tab=wallets#directory). 

An account needs the below information keys to access the Stellar network. 

Threefold token is registered under : 

- AssetCode: `TFT`
- Issuer: `GBOVQKJYHXRR3DX6NOX2RRYFRCUMSADGDESTDNBDS6CDVLGVESRTAC47`

TFTA is registered under:

- AssetCode: `TFTA`
- Issuer: `GBUT4GP5GJ6B3XW5PXENHQA7TXJI5GOPW3NF4W3ZIW6OOO4ISY6WNLN2`

FreeTFT is a separate token with : 

- AssetCode: `FreeTFT`
- Issuer: `GCBGS5TFE2BPPUVY55ZPEMWWGR6CLQ7T6P46SOFGHXEBJ34MSP6HVEUT`

TFT, TFTA and FreeTFT are registered on this blockchain, under the domain `threefold.io` . Some wallets don't require you to introduce asset code and issuer, but need this domain name to find back the tokens on the Stellar network.

## How to buy TFTs

Trading capabilities are not yet available in the 3Bot Connect app, but there is a growing number of options on how you can buy and sell TFTs:

### Centralized exchanges

- [Liquid](https://www.liquid.com/) (centralized exchange, coming soon)
- [BTC Alpha](https://btc-alpha.com/en/) (centralized exchange, coming soon)

### Stellar Decentralized exchange

You can also exchange TFTs with other tokens in a decentralized way, using StellarX, the Stellar decentralized exchange. 

More info can be found [here](tft_stellarx.md).

## Pay capacity

Capacity on the Threefold Grid can only be bought using tokens. These tokens are registered on the Stellar network. 

Two tokens can be used : 

- TFT is the usual currency to be used for capacity reservation. 
- FreeTFT is a token that is freely distributed to 3Bot users, for exploration of the capabilities. Every new 3Bot ID gets 1000 FreeTFT, which can be used for reserving capacity.

## How to get FreeTFTs

There is a possibility to connect to us, for useful projects that want to explore the grid, an amount of 1000 FreeTFT per 3Bot can be obtained, available to pay capacity on the Threefold Grid. 

To claim your 1000 FreeTFT, go to the [website](https://www.getfreetft.threefold.io) and fill in the application form.
