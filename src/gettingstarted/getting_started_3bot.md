# 3Bot

As your digital presence on the TF Grid, 3Bot plays a crucial role in creating, monitoring, maintaining activities on top of the TF Grid. Therefore, __3Bot__ comes with a system administrator panel; a powerful tool that helps you deploy, maintain and monitor your solutions and workloads on top of the Threefold Grid.
