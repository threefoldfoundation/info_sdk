# Getting Started

To get started and deploy a solution on top of the TF Grid, you would need to first figure out of whether you would like to build on top of the __TF Grid Testnet__ or __TF Grid Mainnet__. 

- Go to [__Start on Mainnet__](mainnet_getting_started.md) : the production net (grid 2.2)
- Go to [__Start on Testnet__](testnet_getting_started.md) : where is the latest updates of our software is being tested.

> Please keep in mind that the two networks are completely separated, and thus every activity done on testnet cannot be applied to the mainnet, and vice versa. For example, You would not be able to purchase capacity on TF Grid mainnet by using the testnet TFT you have on your testnet wallet.
