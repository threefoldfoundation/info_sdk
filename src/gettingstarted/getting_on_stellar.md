### Getting your 3bot connect to the Stellar network

The 3Bot Connect app has a Wallet inside, accessed using either the seed keys of the 3Bot connect app or an imported seed key. 
The wallet allows you to show your balance in TFTs and FreeTFTs, as well as transferring (sending and receiving) tokens. 
Trading on the StellarX DEX is not yet possible using 3Bot Connect app (under construction). This is why it can be useful to install other wallets, which are able to do trades on the Stellar DEX. 

### How to get a Stellar account in the 3Bot Connect app

Accounts need to be activated on the Stellar network. 
You can do this doing the following steps : 
- push the activation button
- send an sms with the 5 character code to the shown sms number 

<!--- TODO add screenshots 3Bot Connect app for activation and code --->

Sending this sms will trigger the activation of the account on the Stellar Network, and the creation of a trustline to the issuer of the token. 
Once activation is done, you can start sending and receiving TFTs.

## Pay capacity

Capacity on the Threefold Network can only be bought using tokens. These tokens are registered on the Stellar network. 

Two tokens can be used : 
- TFT is the usual currency to be used for capacity reservation. 
- FreeTFT is a token that is freely distributed to 3Bot users, for exploration of the capabilities. Every new 3Bot ID gets 1000 FreeTFT, which can be used for reserving capacity.

## How to get FreeTFTs

Every 3bot gives right to 1000 FreeTFTs, available to pay capacity on the Threefold network. 

To claim your 1000 FreeTFT, go to the website and claim your tokens.
