## Getting your 3bot connect to the Stellar network

The 3Bot Connect app has a Wallet inside, accessed using either the seed keys of the 3Bot connect app or an imported seed key. 

This wallet uses these keys to access the Stellar network. 
Both TFT and FreeTFT are registered on this blockchain, under the domain threefold.io . 

Threefold token is registered under : 
- AssetCode TFT
- Issuer GBOVQKJYHXRR3DX6NOX2RRYFRCUMSADGDESTDNBDS6CDVLGVESRTAC47

FreeTFT is a separate token with : 
- AssetCode FreeTFT
- Issuer GCBGS5TFE2BPPUVY55ZPEMWWGR6CLQ7T6P46SOFGHXEBJ34MSP6HVEUT

The wallet allows you to show your balance in TFTs and FreeTFTs, as well as transferring (sending and receiving) tokens. 

## How to get an account on Stellar

Accounts need to be activated on the Stellar network. 
You can do this doing the following steps : 
- push the activation button
- send an sms with the 5 character code to the shown sms number 

Sending this sms will trigger the activation of the account on the Stellar Network, and the creation of a trustline to the issuer of the token. 
Once activation is done, you can start sending and receiving TFTs.

## How to get FreeTFTs

## Pay capacity

Capacity on the Threefold Network can only be bought using tokens. These tokens are registered on the Stellar network. 

Two tokens can be used : 
- TFT is the usual currency to be used for capacity reservation. 
- FreeTFT is a token that is freely distributed to 3Bot users, for exploration of the capabilities. Every new 3Bot ID gets 1000 FreeTFT, which can be used for reserving capacity
