Seed Phrase allows you to access and recover your wallet from any device. 
We highly recommend write down your seed key on a paper and store it safely offline.

> **3Bot does not have any access to or maintain records of your private key. It is your personal responsibility to keep your 24-word private key in a safe place.**

> **Do not share your private key with anyone, it is strictly personal. Losing your private key means losing access to your wallet and all your ThreeFold Tokens.**

> **Anybody with access to your private key can take ownership of your 3Bot Connect wallet and ThreeFold tokens**
