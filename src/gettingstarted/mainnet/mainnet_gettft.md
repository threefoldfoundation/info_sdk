2. Get TFT through a [__Stellar decentralized exchange__](threefold:how_to_buy_and_sell)
3. Purchase TFT directly from a [__ThreeFold Farmer__](threefold:how_to_buy_and_sell)

- If you have had some experience with trading, buying and selling digital currencies:
    - We'd recommend you go through one of the digital currency exchanges if those are available in your country. 
    - Or use a Stellar decentralized exchange.
- If you  have little to no experience with trading, buying and selling digital currencies:
    - We'd recommend you to purchase TFT directly from a TF Farmer.

_Keep in mind buying digital currencies through exchanges does involve some steps and time, but in the end this is because there is an exchange of money happening – so security, verification of identity, and related procedures are quite important._
