# ThreeFold Grid Manual

![](img/storage_compute.png)

Hi! Welcome to the __TF Grid Manual__, the knowledge base for those interested in learning more about how to create and deploy IT Solutions on top of our Peer2Peer Cloud.

## Concepts

- **Cloud** = the engine of the internet <BR>*all compute, storage & network capacity required for the internet to function.*
- **Peer2Peer Cloud** = a cloud not owned by a few <BR>*A cloud created by all of us for everyone, usable by anyone.*
- **ThreeFold Grid** = TFGrid = the biggest active Peer2Peer Cloud in the world.
- **3Bot** = your virtual system administrator who helps you to develop, deploy and manage solutions on the ThreeFold Grid
- **3Node** = the computer (server) which delivers the compute,storage and network capacity to the TFGrid
- **ZOS** = Zero-OS the operating system which empowers the cloud and runs on top of the 3Node's.
