# How to Deploy Digibyte Node on eVDC

Through our partnership with the DigiByte Foundation, we empower the DGB community with a decentralized cloud infrastructure to deploy DigiByte nodes and help secure and expand the DGB network across the geographical edges.

- Anyone can contribute and build upon the DigiByte Blockchain using the ThreeFold P2P cloud and its developer tools that provide significant advantages over centralized cloud providers.
- Thousands of people are running DigiByte software all across the planet.
- Any server, computer, tablet or mobile phone connected to the DigiByte network becomes a node that helps relay transactions.

# Get Started

You can now deploy your own DigiByte full Node via the ThreeFold Now Marketplace's dashboard on your eVDC admin panel in a few clicks.

First step, find the __Digibyte Widget__ on the marketplace and click on __'Deploy'__ button. You will now will be directed to the chatflow of the deployment process.

Select the domain type for your Digibyte Node. For deployment with random subdomain, select 'Choose subdomain for me on a gateway',. For deployment with a particular available subdomain, select 'Choose a custom subdomain on a gateway. To deploy a Digibyte Node using your own domain, select 'choose a custom domain'.
