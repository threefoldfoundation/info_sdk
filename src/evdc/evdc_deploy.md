# How to deploy eVDC

## First, visit the eVDC Deployer 

[Mainnet vdc](https://vdc.grid.tf) (coming soon)

[Testnet vdc](https://vdc.testnet.grid.tf)

- You'll see the option to create your Virtual Data Center.
- Simply choose the option you want to launch from the menu.
- You'll need to log in through Threefold Connect, an authenticator for the full ThreeFold ecosystem.
- You can find more on ThreeFold Connect [here](https://manual.threefold.io/#/threefold_connect_install).

## Next, use the guided setup to create your private VDC

- Options are there to reserve a new VDC in different sizes, delete it or extend with extra K8S clusters or in time.
- VDC comes with options for monitoring (using Grafana and Prometheus tooling).
- A wallet can be configured within the deployment website, enabling easy payment. 
- If you're feeling lost, each live tool has a tutorial on its page here on the wiki.
